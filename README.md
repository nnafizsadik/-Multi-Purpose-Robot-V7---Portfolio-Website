## ⚙️ Robot Core Features

- 🧨 **Bomb Disposal Unit:** Detects and neutralizes explosives up to **2.4m underground** using robotic arms and integrated **RF/GPS/IR jamming**.  
- 🔥 **Firefighting Mode:** Built with **heat-absorbing, fireproof materials** and a **heat-to-electricity self-charging system** (operational tolerance up to 2600°C).  
- 🏚️ **Earthquake Rescue Mode:** Uses **DODA sensors** to locate victims and administer **CPR / DC shock** automatically based on cardiac signals.  
- ⚡ **Self-Charging Power System:** Converts ambient heat into electrical power for extended missions.  
- 📡 **Secure Communication & Jamming:** Integrated Flysky RF control with custom jamming logic for safe high-risk operations.



## 🧠 Additional Skills & Focus

**Developer & Researcher:**  
- Full-stack web development (React + Vite + Tailwind)  
- Robotics software integration (Arduino, Raspberry Pi)  
- **Ethical hacking & cybersecurity research** — security-first design, responsible disclosure, and defensive signal/communication practices.

> If you want an explicit "Responsible Disclosure" or security page in the site, I can draft that too.
